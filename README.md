# Cassandra Cluster Playground

This project will demo several key concepts in Cassandra NoSQL database such as replication and tunble consistency level.
Good news is that everything can be done locally on your Mac.

## Install Cassandra

```brew install cassandra```

By default, Cassandra uses port 7000 for cluster communication (port 7001 if SSL is enabled), port 9042 for native protocol clients, and port 7199 for JMX.
